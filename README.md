## Motivation
Learning is a lifelong journey, regardless of whether you're a student or not. The learning process involves two key components: the initial acquisition of knowledge and the retention of that knowledge in memory.  
Spaced repetition is an effective learning technique that enhances long-term memory retention. This method involves reviewing the same material multiple times at increasing intervals, which helps transfer information from short-term to long-term memory.  
While there are numerous flashcard applications available, I decided to create Flashyy for several reasons:

1. Open-source: I believe in the power of community-driven development and transparency.
2. Self-hostable: This feature provides users with more control over their data and learning environment.
3. Alternative to existing solutions: I wanted to offer a different approach from popular apps like Anki, catering to users who may be seeking a fresh perspective.

Flashyy aims to combine these principles with effective learning techniques to provide a unique and valuable learning tool.
